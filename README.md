Topic_Modelling_LDA(BoW).ipynb - This script has the cranfield data imported , preprocessed, LDA models with bag of words built for varying hyperparameter(number of topics), 
the evaluation metrics, visualization of the same and the performance evaluation of the optimal model on the unseen data.

Topic_Modelling_LDA(TF_IDF) - This script has the LDA models built using the TF-IDF vectorizer, evaluation metrics and the performance of the opti,mal model on the unseen data.

Topic_Modelling_LDAMallet - This script has the code to set up the environment variable to execute the LDAMallet models, script to find the optimal number of topics for a 
particular dataset and its performance using the metrics (coherence) and on the unseen data.

The details about the dataset, preprocessing, hyperparameter selection, models,  performance evaluation and the result analysis on the models are available in the pdf report.
